The model itself works fine, but the real problem is with the dataset itself, as it is very inconsistent and has various anomalies like different pricing for similar house properties. The dataset is heavily right skewed, meaning, it has a very few number of properties with abnormaly high prices. I tackled this skewness problem by manually defining the highiest price value to certain limit which cannot be exceeded. I know this is not the right way to solve these kind of problems but as a beginner in the machine learning field, I am not used to other conventional ways to solve this issue. Hope this project is useful to you guyz. If you have any proper solution to this problem, do mention that.

Thank you!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
